# Division
# # Gives a float in Python
print(4 / 2)

# Exponent or raising a number to a power

# PEMDAS(LR) - Parentheses Exponents Multiplication Division Addition Subtraction (Left to Right)
# BODMAS(LR) - Bracket Of Division Multiplication Addition Subtraction (Left to Right)

# When it comes to calculation, 'Multiplication & Division' and 'Addition & Subtraction' are both equally
# important, the calculation that is most to the left is the one that will be prioritized between Multiplication and
# Division and between Addition and Subtraction, the calculation goes from left to right as shown below:
print(3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3)
print(3 / 3 - 3 * 3 + 3)
print(3 * (3 + 3) / 3 - 3)
